## ðŸŽ® About the Project
This is a 2D space shooter game developed in Unity as part of "the-complete-unity-c-game-developer-bootcamp" by DevGameHQ.
As a beginner, I'm learning C# and Unity while also putting my experience with gaming to good use by implementing my own behavior and design to the project. 

### My personal changes and implementations:
- Slight differences in the way the code is implemented.
- Movement behavior on enemy death.
- Both player's and enemy's rate of fire.
- **Added** the ability for the player's laser to destroy and negate the enemy's laser once they collide.
- **Added** randomized backgrounds whenever a new game instance is occuring (through new game or restart).
- **Added** Exit Game button and textures to the buttons in the Main Menu.
- **Added** new font.
- **Added** High Score and New High Score elements at the end of the session.
- **Added** SFX when the player is hit.
